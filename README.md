# Subsurface Logging Portfolio

This repository contains examples of subsurface boring and well logs
prepared from historic drilling records and public datasets.

## Included Logs
- Clay County, Missouri – Alluvial monitoring well (1957)
- St. Louis County, Missouri – Bedrock well (1948)

## Methods
- Lithologic and construction details interpreted from original scanned well logs
- Location, elevation, and metadata verified using Missouri GeoSTRAT
- Conservative documentation practices used where data were incomplete

## Purpose
These logs were prepared as part of a professional skills refresher
to demonstrate subsurface logging, data reconciliation, and
documentation practices relevant to geotechnical and environmental work.
